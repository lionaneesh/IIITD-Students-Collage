Coursera startup class's photo tiles
====================================

While trying to know more about the students. I've scrapped user information off the class's forum and presented it in form of photo tiles. Into one big html page.

The order of the tiles is random it changes on every visit. You can click on tiles to know more about the user like his facebook/linkedin/googleplus profile links, bio, location etc.
